A Maven image with dockerize utility.
dockerize is a utility to simplify running applications in docker containers. It allows you to:

   1. generate application configuration files at container startup time from templates and container environment variables
   2. Tail multiple log files to stdout and/or stderr
   3. Wait for other services to be available using TCP, HTTP(S), unix before starting the main process.
